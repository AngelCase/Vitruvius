Haskellの関数は関数をパラメータとしてとることができ、
また関数を戻り値として返せる。
これらのどちらかを行う関数を高階関数という。


Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values. A function that does either of those is called a higher order function. Higher order functions aren't just a part of the Haskell experience, they pretty much are the Haskell experience. It turns out that if you want to define computations by defining what stuff _is_ instead of defining steps that change some state and maybe looping them, higher order functions are indispensable. They're a really powerful way of solving problems and thinking about programs.
